A basic account with me just trying to figure out whats happening
A basic repository with only the README file and thats it so far since I dont fully understand this software 
I clicked my main repository and clicked the button clone repository and I selected the file that I wanted it under and it downloaded it and Im still unsure of whats fully going on.
